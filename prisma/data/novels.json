    "description": "Echo is a horror visual novel about a small, isolated, desert town located somewhere in the southwestern states.\nDuring spring break, Chase, a young otter who grew up in Echo, is back for a school project aimed at documenting an event in the 1870's that may have led to the town's current state. He's joined by five friends, who grew up with him in Echo, taking the chance to have a little reunion. Unfortunately, Chase begins to realize that their memories of Echo may have been a bit rose-tinted. Being back in the town digs up old and painful memories; secrets that lead to rifts in the group that have been boiling under the surface for years. On top of that, Chase begins to realize that Echo itself may have its own secrets. Odd and unexplained memories that he always blamed on an overactive childhood imagination may not have been imagined at all.\n Finally, an event is triggered that turns these fears into something much more tangible and dangerous. Chase is now forced into a situation in which he must help his friends either face, or escape their demons. Either way, Echo is not keen on letting them go...",

    "description": "CW: Arches is a horror story that can be an emotionally intense experience for some readers. Themes of drug addiction, mental illness, and physical and mental abuse are explored, along with descriptions and imagery of brief, but intense violence. Please consider your mental well-being before downloading. In March 2020, boyfriends Cameron and Devon arrive in the ghost town of Echo to conduct a paranormal investigation. It has been five years since the mass hysteria supposedly left the town completely abandoned. While it does seem empty at first, they realize that something evil still lurks in Echo, evil enough that it has kept the horrors alive. Arches is a standalone story that takes place after the events of Echo.
