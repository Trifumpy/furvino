      <Typography>
        I want furries to discover and download all furry visual novels for free, with no ads, censorship as well as giving space for creators to publish their work without hassle for free and all in one place.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        My long term goal with this website is to create a platform where creators get a full amount from what you donated (excluding payment processing fees).<br/>
        Another goal for me would be that the users can choose to enable advertisements deployed on the website and all of the revenue from these ads would go to support a charity that the community chooses!
